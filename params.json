  "name": "tools4BCI - TiA Scope",
  "tagline": "",
  "body": "### Why?\r\nEspecially for biosignal measurements, it is very often crucial to monitor recorded signals online. This has to be done to recognize potential artifacts soon enough. Otherwise, maybe the whole measurement would have to be repeated, e.g., like an EEG measurement contaminated by heavy EMG noise, caused by a participant who constantly clenched his face muscles.\r\nThus, a simple scope application, utilizing the TiA protocol was implemented for this purpose.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Usage of the TiA library with all its features\r\n* Cross platform\r\n* Continuous scrolling or cyclic update\r\n* Channel overlapping\r\n* Channel zooming\r\n* Variable plotting time window\r\n* Variable lowpass filter\r\n* Currently in development: Support for connection based channel selection and downsampling\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n* Zoom in/out all channels: Shift + mouse wheel\r\n* Zoom in/out single channel: Move mouse over desired channel; Ctrl + mouse wheel\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\nThe authors are grateful to **Christoph Eibel**, who did a really great job in implementing the TiA Scope.",
